# Interactive AR Recruitment Poster

## Introduction
Welcome to the Interactive AR Recruitment Poster project! This project is at the forefront of engaging prospective members for our technical society in college. By scanning our recruitment poster, users are greeted with an augmented reality (AR) version that is not only interactive but also educational, providing insights into the various domains we teach.

## Features
- **AR Poster Scanning**: Simply scan our specially designed recruitment poster to launch the AR experience.
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Explore the different technical domains we cover, all within the AR environment.
- **Engagement and Interaction**: Learn about our society and interact with the content in a fun and immersive way.

## Tech Stack
- **Unity 3D Engine**: Our core platform for developing the 3D interactive content.
- **Vuforia Engine**: Provides the advanced AR capabilities, including image recognition to bring our posters to life.

## How It Works
1. The app uses the camera to scan the recruitment poster.
2. The Vuforia Engine recognizes the poster and overlays an interactive AR version on top of it.
3. Users can then interact with the AR poster to learn about the various technical domains offered by our society.
